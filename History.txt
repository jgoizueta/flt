== 1.1.1 2009-11-30

* New Features:
  - Math.hypot

  - Tolerance fix for near zero numbers
  - Other internal problems

== 1.0.0 2009-08-05

* First release of the new Flt project (derived from the former Ruby-Decimal.)
  - New gem name: flt
  - New organization in Flt namespace
  - Arbitrary base support; Flt::DecNum replaces Decimal; new classes BinNum, Num[b].
  - Tolerance objects to define floating-point tolerances.
  - Free and fixed input/output formats.
  - Contexts for Float and BigDecimal compatibility with Flt::Num

== 0.2.2 2009-07-21

* Bug fixes:
  - Decimal#normal? was incorrect for special values and zero.
  - After a local context, the global context was set to a copy of the original
    context, so any previously stored reference to it was now unbound.
  - Context#normalize was incorrect.

== 0.2.1 2009-06-23

* Bug fixes:
  - DecNum#inspect was always producing debug information; now it uses $DEBUG
  - Raising some exceptions caused error, because too many parameters were being
    passed to the exception's base class initializer.

* New functionality:
  - ulp (unit in the last place)
  - normalize (in the classic sense, not in the original GDA sense)
  - maximum_finite, minimum_normal, minimum_nonzero value decimal constructors
  - epsilon, strict_epsilon, half_epsilon
  - setting context exponent limits with elimit
  - require decimal/shortcut to use D for DecNum

== 0.2.0 2009-06-21
